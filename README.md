# Using Python to Solve a Matrix

These files utilizes the Jacobi Approximation method, the Gauss-Seidel method, and the Successive-Over-Relaxation (SOR) method to approximate the solution to a matrix. The errors are compared to the built-in linalg solver. 

As observed from the example in the files, the SOR method approximates the matrix in the least number of iterations.
